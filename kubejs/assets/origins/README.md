# Origins Mod for Minecraft

https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins

This is the GitHub repository for the Origins mod, created for Fabric.

If you need help with **creating data packs** for the mod, visit [the official wiki](https://origins.readthedocs.io/). At some point in the future, this wiki will also contain information on how to create an add-on for the mod.

If you want to **report a bug**, please visit [the issue tracker](https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric/issues). Make sure to check other existing issues first, and post detailed information about which mods and which version you are using, what you would expect to happen, and what happens instead. Also always include the log of your client and the server if possible.
