Inmis is a Backpack mod built for the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/). 
It requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) to be installed separately.
By default, you can right-click a Backpack to open it, or press `B` to open the first Backpack available in your inventory.
Backpacks can be equipped in the Chestplate armor slot and opened through the same keybind.

### Compatibility

If you install [Trinkets](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/trinkets-fabric) alongside Inmis, you will be able to equip Inmis Backpacks in the backpack Trinket slot.

For previewing Backpacks, try out [ShulkerBoxTooltip](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/shulkerboxtooltip)!

### Configuration âš™

Inmis is fully configurable through the `config/inmis.json` file found in your game directory. 
This will allow to you disable main-inventory backpacks, require players to wear Backpacks in armor slots, and even allows you to add your own custom backpacks!
