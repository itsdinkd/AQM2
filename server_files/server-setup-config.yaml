  # This is the command how the server is supposed to be started
  # All arguments must be separate entries, including options and their values.
  # For example, "--fml.modLists pathToModListFile" should be:
  #  - "--fml.modLists"
  #  - "pathToModListFile"
  #
  # Forge:
  #   For <1.16 it should be
  #    - "-jar"
  #    - "{{@startFile@}}"

  # If you aren't sure what the java path is you can let serverstarter attempt to find the correct JVM
