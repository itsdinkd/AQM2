/*
This config file makes it possible to change the spacing, separation, salt (and frequency) of Towns and Towers' structure sets. Big thanks to Cristelknight for making this all possible.
	SPACING ---  controls how far a structure can be from others of its kind
	SEPARATION --- controls how close to each other two structures of the same type can be.
By default, the values should be 48/24 for villages and outposts (spacing/separation respectively) - a hypothetical village is going to appear not further than 48 chunks away (ca. 760 blocks), but not closer than 24 chunks (ca. 380 blocks).
       * If you want a structure to spawn more frequently, decrease those values.
       * If you want a structure to spawn less frequently, increase those values.
KEEP IN MIND THAT SPACING ALWAYS NEEDS TO BE HIGHER THAN SEPARATION.
